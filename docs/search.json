As explained in the paper, the test is to see whether values appear next to appropriate neighboring values. In nearly all cases, ours do.\n\nUnderstandably, the MDS plots for the models appear quite distorted.\n\ngemmaphiqwen"

In other words, that each person has a hierarchy of these 10 values. To further explore this with our lyrics, we treat each lyric excerpt as a ‘person’, by computing a ranked list from the mean ratings of each value. We then do the same with our LLM ratings, and compute ranked list correlations per song. Here we plot the distribution of ranked list correlations, per model.\n\nPrior work has suggested that correlations of .2 are meaningful. Here we look at what proportion exceed that threshold, per model.\n\n\n\nmodel\nn\nprop\n\n\n\n\ngemma2:9b\n284\n71.0\n\n\nphi4\n314\n78.5\n\n\nqwen2.5:7b\n276\n69.0\n\n\n\nNote: \n\n\n\n\n Note. n = number of songs; prop &gt;= 2 = proportion of songs"
